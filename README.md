🗂️ Kanban Task Management App

A full-stack Kanban board application built with Angular and .NET Web API.
Based on a Frontend Mentor challenge and extended with a custom backend for data persistence.

📌 About The Project

This project is a solution to a Frontend Mentor Kanban challenge, expanded into a full-stack application.
While the original challenge focuses on frontend UI implementation, I extended it by:
 - Building a .NET Web API backend
 - Designing a relational database
 - Implementing full CRUD functionality
 - Persisting data instead of using static JSON
 - The result is a complete Kanban task management system with real backend integration.

🎯 The Challenge

Original design provided by Frontend Mentor.
The goal was to build a responsive Kanban board UI that matches the design as closely as possible.
